# Shield-Insurance-Analysis

The pilot project for Shield Insurance focuses on leveraging data analytics to gain actionable insights into customer behavior, revenue generation, and business growth trends. Key objectives include:

- Customer and Revenue Metrics: Identify total customers and revenue, tracking daily growth rates for both to monitor business performance.
- Policy Trend Monitoring: Analyze month-over-month changes in policies to identify trends and optimize offerings.
- Customer Segmentation: Segment customers by age group and analyze revenue and customer distribution across cities and demographic brackets.
- Trend Analysis and Visualization: Develop interactive tools to toggle between revenue and customer growth trend graphs, supported by filters for sales mode, age group, city, month, and policy ID.
- Sales Mode Insights: Dedicate a page to evaluate sales mode performance, including customer and revenue split percentages and monthly trends.
- Age Group Insights: Create a detailed analysis of age group data, focusing on settlement expectations, sales modes, and policy preferences to guide business strategies.

This initiative aims to establish a robust analytical foundation, driving data-driven decisions and enhancing Shield Insurance's ability to deliver tailored solutions and achieve growth objectives.
